### PokeyStahp

This app was written to test out how easy it would be to setup a Rails project with relational models and a very basic front-end.

Other than the generated code it contains:

- Controllers
- Views
- Models
- Seeds (got a little carried away)

All of the Pokey information in this project was taken from: https://pokemondb.net/pokedex
